You make a feature branch f1 out of master when master was at commit m1 , while working on feature branch f1 ,master moved to 1 commit next .i.e m2 
with few changes. But for merging feature branch we need to update feature branch with latest updates of master m2 and resolve any merge conflicts if any:

git checkout master
git pull
git checkout featureBranch
git merge master
//resolve any conflicts if there 
git add the files after resolving conflicts
git commit 
git push feature branch 

//now post review it can be merged with master
